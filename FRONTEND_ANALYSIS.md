## Design System Compliance

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- Dark-mode-first with OKLCH colors
- Glassmorphism with backdrop-blur
- Radial lighting backgrounds
- Glow effects on hover
- Smooth micro-interactions
- Semi-opaque glass cards
- Rounded corners (8-20px)
- High-contrast borders

### üéØ To Enhance
- Staggered entrance animations for lists
- Route transitions (fade/slide)
- Inline form validation with accessible focus
- Parallax effects in hero (subtle)
- Particle/radial light animation
- WCAG AA compliance testing
- prefers-reduced-motion support

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Pages (Week 1)
1. About Page
2. Enhanced Home Page with all sections
3. Events & Workshops Page
4. Projects & Showcases Page

### Phase 2: Authentication & Members (Week 2)
1. Authentication system (OAuth + email)
2. Member profiles
3. Dashboard (members-only)
4. Protected routes

### Phase 3: Interactive Features (Week 3)
1. RSVP system for events
2. Project submission/showcase
3. Resources library with search
4. Newsletter signup

### Phase 4: Admin & Advanced (Week 4)
1. Admin dashboard
2. Event management
3. Analytics integration
4. Real-time features (WebSockets)

## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create design tokens file** - Centralize all visual constants
2. **Build page templates** - Reusable layouts for different page types
3. **Implement routing** - Set up all page routes in App Router
4. **Add form library** - React Hook Form + Zod (already in package.json)
5. **Connect to Django API** - Use existing api.ts utilities

### Architecture Patterns
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design (atoms ‚Üí molecules ‚Üí organisms)
- **State Management**: React Context for auth, local state for UI
- **Data Fetching**: Server Components where possible, client components for interactivity
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries with ErrorReporter component
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with no implicit any

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting per route
- Lazy loading for heavy components (charts, 3D elements)
- Prefetch important routes
- CDN for static assets
- Server-side rendering for public pages

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML throughout
- ARIA labels for custom controls
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus visible styles (already implemented)
- High contrast mode support
- Screen reader testing

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive design tokens file
2. Build page layouts and templates
3. Implement About, Events, Projects pages
4. Set up authentication flow
5. Build member dashboard
6. Add RSVP and project submission features
7. Implement search and filters
8. Add admin dashboard
9. Integrate analytics
10. Test accessibility and performance
