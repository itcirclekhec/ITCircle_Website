        "Technical approach:
        1. Add technology fields to the Project model in Django
        2. Create API endpoints for filtering projects
        3. Build frontend filtering UI with dropdowns and checkboxes
        4. Add URL parameters for shareable filtered views

        Design considerations:
        - Use existing UI patterns for consistency
        - Make filters collapsible on mobile
        - Add a 'Clear all filters' option"
